# Race Day

_This JavaScript program is designed to assist race organizers in registering runners and providing instructions for race day. The program allows both adult and youth runners to register early or late and assigns a race number and start time based on their age and registration._

## Explanation 📖

### Registration Process 📝
During the registration process, runners will be asked to provide their age. If the runner is 18 years old, they will be directed to the registration desk to complete the process. The program will then assign each runner a random race number and start time based on their age and registration status.

### Race Number 👟
Early adult registrants (over 18 years of age) will receive a race number at or above 1000, while all other runners will receive a number below 1000.

### Start Time ⏱️
The program will assign start times based on the runner's age and registration status:
- Early adult registrants will run at 9:30 am.
- Late adult registrants will run at 11:00 am.
- Youth registrants will run at 12:30 pm, regardless of registration status.
